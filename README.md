# **myFlix Client (using React)**

This is a full-stack movie application designed to showcase a comprehensive **RESTful API** architecture alongside a modern client-side experience. The server is built using **Node.js** with **Express** and interacts with a **MongoDB Atlas** database to handle user authentication, movie data storage, and retrieval. 

The client-side is a **Single Page Application (SPA)** currently under development, built with **React** and managed using **Yarn**. **Parcel** is utilized as the blazing-fast, zero-configuration web application bundler for development and production builds. This project emphasizes a clear separation between a robust API and a dynamic, component-based frontend.

## **Installation**

### **Prerequisites**
You will need to install the following software on your machine:

- **Node.js**
- **Yarn**
- **MongoDB Community Server** (or preferred database software) 

1. **Clone the repository**

4. 
## **Deployment**
These steps will set you up to run the project locally.   

1. **Start the Database**
- Make sure your **database** server (e.g. MongoDB Atlas) is running 
  
2. **Start your Server/API**
```
Bash
```
```
# In your Heroku server directory
yarn start
# The server will run on http://localhost:8080 (or your configured port)
```




- git clone at https://github.com/HeatherR206/myFlix-client.git
- cd parcel src/index.html
- The default myFlix API URL is http://localhost:8080
- The live URL (development stage) is
